Deep Learning backed by Supervised and Unsupervised PCA analysis of Tabular Medical Data with MIMIC-III using Advanced visuallization methods.
workflow: Raw Data interpretation -> ML models -> Clustering -> Deep Neural Networks

Step 1: understanding raw data. examining the most cruciel elemnts of the data.

Step 3: PCA and t-SNE

Demonstrate the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction on the dataset focusing on BMI, Blood sodium, and Blood calcium to visualize the data in a reduced-dimensional space. Compare the visualization results of PCA and t-SNE.

Conclusion: Dataset is too small to effectivly train a DNN, its similar results to classic ML classification methods like LogisticRegression and SVM.Even when using earlyStopping and advanced methods and tuning, a denser structure and feature list, there is not a big improvement.
